Project core is written in DOT language with significant use of C preprocessor, and compiled with Graphviz [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz].

Use of C preprocessor actually makes the sourcecode readable and meaningful. It allows constructions like:
    "Arthas" -> "King Teranas" [KILLS]
    where KILLS is defined via #define clausule at the very beginning of the code:

    #define KILLS color="red" label="X" fontcolor="red" fontsize="11" arrowhead="vee" arrowtail="vee"
    It reminds HTML + CSS coding.

Almost everything is based on Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos manual and Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne games storyline. Some informations were taken here from Wowwiki [http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_relations_map].
